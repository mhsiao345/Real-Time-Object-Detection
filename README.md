1. Make a copy of the jupyter notebook and run the cells to construct a training dataset of the objects you want for real-time detection.

2. Or, copy the entire project, load the saved model, and see how well it does in detecting your 'pen', 'ruler', 'scissor', or 'stapler'.
   - the captures.zip file contains the train and test images used to train and validate the tensorflow model.
